					<h1> Wine  </h1>
                <p>   Orange Wine is our Speciality. </p> 
                <p>  What is Orange wine? </p> 
                <p>Orange wine is a bit of a misnomer. It is not a wine made with oranges, nor is it a Mimosa cocktail. Orange wine is something entirely different. </p> 
                
<p> To make an orange wine, you first take white grapes, mash them up, and then put them in a large vessel (often cement or ceramic). Then, you typically leave the fermenting grapes alone for four days to sometimes over a year with the skins and seeds still attached.
This is a natural process that uses little to no additives, sometimes not even yeast. Because of all this, they taste very different from regular white wines and have a sour taste and nuttiness from oxidation.

                <p> Our line of Orange Wines features unique and bold flavor profiles: </p>

<p> CALCARIUS 2018: robust and bold, with honeyed aromas of tropical jackfruit </p>
<p>[picture of wine label and bottle #1] </p>

<p>ORANGE BLISS 2019: Strong notes of hazelnut, brazil nut, bruised apple, and oh so sweet bliss. </p>
<p>[picture of wine label and bottle #2] </p>

<p>FRESH FARMER 2017: wood varnish, linseed oil, juniper, sourdough, and dried orange rind.</p>

<p>[picture of wine label and bottle #3]</p>

<p>Because of their boldness, Orange wines pair well with equally bold foods, including curry dishes, Moroccan cuisine, Ethiopian cuisine, Korean dishes with fermented kimchi, and traditional Japanese cuisine, including fermented soybeans. They are diverse, flavorful, and pair well with a large variety of meats and fish.
