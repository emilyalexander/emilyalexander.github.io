                                <p>
                                    There is no question that there are major issues around sustainability and clothes. That fashion brands bear enormous responsibility for carbon emissions and chemical runoff and landfill gluts in different parts of the world. Textiles are thought to be the second most harmful material that can end up in our bins. Not only do they produce toxins, but they can also take hundreds of years to decompose (if they do at all).

                                    Your guide to conscious consumerism. From an anxiety-inducing number of Fairtrade coffees to expensive organic cereals, one glance around your supermarket tells you all you need to know: social responsibility sells. And while Whole Food’s costly peanut butter might induce a solid eye roll, ethical shopping isn’t simply confined to the walls of your local any more. Increasing awareness around issues such as human rights, equal pay and sustainable development, to name a few, has led to a rise in what is known as conscious consumerism.

                                <p>
                                    Compost is organic material that can be added to soil to help plants grow. Food scraps and yard waste together currently make up more than 28 percent of what we throw away, and should be composted instead. Making compost keeps these materials out of landfills where they take up space and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

                                <p>
                                    The global fast fashion industry is often called out for the exploitative working conditions in its factories that are staffed primarily by impoverished women — especially in Asia. Many of these workers toil for little pay and have few rights, largely so clothing manufacturers in Europe and the US can keep costs low. The industry again came under the spotlight recently as a German court case sought to determine whether local discount clothing manufacturer KiK should be held responsible for the poor working conditions at its supplier company in Pakistan.

                                <p>
                                    The biggest reason to care for our planet is pretty obvious: So that we as a species can continue to thrive on it. We have a moral and ethical obligation to each other, future generations and other species to sustain this place. When we don’t act responsibly we are choosing to exacerbate the problems future generations will face. The choices we make right now have a direct impact on the future — that’s a serious responsibility.
